The pull-up movement uses multiple muscles at once, making it a compound exercise."},

It enables both building six-pack abs and tightening the belly. Crunches use the exerciser's own body weight to tone muscle and are recommended by some experts, despite negative research results, as a low-cost exercise that can be performed at home. Crunches are less effective than other exercises such as planks and carry risk of back injury."},
